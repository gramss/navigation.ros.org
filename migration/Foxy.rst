Foxy to Galactic
################

Moving from ROS 2 Foxy to Galactic, a number of stability improvements were added that we will not specifically address here.

NavigateToPose BT-node Interface Changes
****************************************

The NavigateToPose input port has been changed to PoseStamped instead of Point and Quaternion.

See :ref:`bt_navigate_to_pose_action` for more information.

BackUp BT-node Interface Changes
********************************

The ``backup_dist`` and ``backup_speed`` input ports should both be positive values indicating the distance to go backward respectively the speed with which the robot drives backward.

BackUp Recovery Interface Changes
*********************************

``speed`` in a backup recovery goal should be positive indicating the speed with which to drive backward.
``target.x`` in a backup recovery goal should be positive indicating the distance to drive backward.
In both cases negative values are silently inverted.

Groot Support
*************

Live Monitoring and Editing of behavior trees with Groot is now possible.
Switching bt-xmls on the fly through a new goal request is also included.
Check out our Groot tutorial!
This is all done without breaking any APIs. All options are off by default.
